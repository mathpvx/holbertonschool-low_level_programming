# C - Search Algorithms

## Description
This project introduces two fundamental search algorithms: linear search and binary search. These algorithms are used to search for a specific value in an array of integers.

## Concepts
- Search Algorithm: Understanding the concept of search algorithms and their importance in computer science.
- Linear Search: Implementing the linear search algorithm to find a value in an unsorted array.
- Binary Search: Implementing the binary search algorithm to find a value in a sorted array.
- Time Complexity: Analyzing the time complexity of each search algorithm.

## Tasks
### 0. Linear search
Write a function `linear_search` that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm. It should return the index of the first occurrence of the value in the array, or -1 if the value is not found.

### 1. Binary search
Write a function `binary_search` that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm. It should return the index of the value in the array, or -1 if the value is not found. The array is assumed to be sorted in ascending order.
