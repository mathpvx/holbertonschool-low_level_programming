# C - Functions, nested loops

This project covers the basics of functions and nested loops in C programming. It includes understanding nested loops, functions, function prototypes, scope of variables, gcc compiler flags, and header files.

## Concepts
- Nested loops: Understanding and using nested loops to perform repetitive tasks.
- Functions: Writing functions to encapsulate code and perform specific tasks.
- Function declaration vs definition: Knowing the difference between declaring a function (prototype) and defining its implementation.
- Prototype: Understanding what a function prototype is and its purpose.
- Scope of variables: Understanding the scope of variables within functions.
- GCC flags: Knowing the purpose and usage of gcc flags like -Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, -std=gnu89.
- Header files: Understanding the purpose of header files and how to use them with #include directive.

## Tasks Examples
### 0. _putchar
Write a program that prints "_putchar", followed by a new line, using the _putchar function.

### 4. isalpha
Write a function named _isalpha that checks whether a character is an alphabetic character (a letter, lowercase or uppercase). The function should return 1 if the character is alphabetic and 0 otherwise.
