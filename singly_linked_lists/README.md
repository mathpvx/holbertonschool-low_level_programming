# C - Singly Linked Lists

## Description
This project introduces the concept of singly linked lists in C programming. It covers building and using linked lists as an alternative to arrays.

## Concepts
- Linked Lists vs Arrays: Understanding when and why to use linked lists over arrays.
- Building and Using Linked Lists: Learning how to construct and manipulate singly linked lists.

## Tasks
### 0. Print list
Write a function `print_list` that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. It should return the number of nodes in the list. If `str` is NULL, it should print `[0] (nil)`.

### 3. Add node at the end
Write a function `add_node_end` that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. It should return the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed. The `str` argument needs to be duplicated, and you are allowed to use `strdup`.
