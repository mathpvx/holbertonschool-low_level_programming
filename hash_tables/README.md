# C - Hash Tables

## Description
This project introduces the concept of hash tables in C programming. It covers understanding hash functions, hash tables, collisions, and their advantages and drawbacks.

## Concepts
- Hash Function: Understanding what a hash function is and what makes a good hash function.
- Hash Table: Learning how hash tables work, how to use them, and dealing with collisions.
- Advantages and Drawbacks: Understanding the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables.
- Use Cases: Exploring the most common use cases of hash tables.

## Tasks Examples
### 0. Create a hash table
Write a function `hash_table_create` that creates a hash table. It should take the size of the array as an argument and return a pointer to the newly created hash table. If something goes wrong, it should return NULL.

### 6. Delete a hash table
Write a function `hash_table_delete` that deletes a hash table. It should take the hash table as an argument and free all memory allocated for it.
