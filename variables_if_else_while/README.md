# C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
This project focuses on the fundamentals of C programming, including arithmetic operators, logical operators, relational operators, if statements, else statements, while loops, variable declaration, assignment, and printing values. It also covers the ASCII character set and basic usage of printf for printing variables.

## Concepts
- Arithmetic operators: Understanding and using arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Logical operators: Using logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT to perform logical operations.
- Relational operators: Utilizing relational operators like equals, not equals, greater than, less than, etc., to perform comparisons.
- Boolean values: Understanding what values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C.
- If statements: Writing conditional statements to execute code based on certain conditions.
- Comments: Adding comments to code for documentation and readability.
- Variable declaration: Declaring variables of types char, int, and unsigned int.
- Variable assignment: Assigning values to variables using the assignment operator.
- While loop: Using while loops to repeatedly execute code as long as a specified condition is true.
- printf: Printing the values of variables using printf.
- ASCII character set: Understanding the ASCII character set and its purpose in C programming.

## Tasks
### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
Write a program that assigns a random number to a variable `n` and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces, in ascending order.
