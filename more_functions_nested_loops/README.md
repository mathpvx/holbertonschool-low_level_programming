# C - More functions, more nested loops

A project focusing on the implementation of various functions and nested loops in C.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file

## Tasks Examples

### Task 0: _isupper

**Prototype**: `int _isupper(int c);`

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

Returns 1 if c is uppercase, otherwise returns 0.

### Task 10: Triangles

**Prototype**: `void print_triangle(int size);`

Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

Where size is the size of the triangle.

If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line.

Use the character # to print the triangle.
